1. Introduction

In the realm of e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon stands as a pivotal player, generating vast amounts of operational data daily. This project aims to utilize Python for data cleaning, SQL for database management, and Power BI for dashboard visualization to analyze and visualize Amazon's operational activities effectively.

2. Objectives

Data Collection: Gather diverse datasets related to Amazon's operations, including sales, customer demographics, product details, and logistical information from reliable sources.

Data Cleaning with Python: Use Python and libraries like Pandas to clean and preprocess the collected datasets. Tasks include handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data integrity before storing in a SQL database.

Database Design and Management: Design and implement a relational database schema using SQL. Create tables for storing cleaned data, including customers, orders, products, regions, and other relevant entities.

Dashboard Creation with Power BI: Integrate the cleaned and structured data from the SQL database into Power BI. Develop interactive dashboards featuring KPIs, sales trends, customer segmentation, geographical insights, and product performance metrics.

User Interface and Accessibility: Design a user-friendly interface in Power BI with filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities. Enable stakeholders to explore data dynamically and derive actionable insights from visualizations.

3. Tools and Technologies

Data Cleaning: Python and Pandas for data cleaning tasks such as handling missing data, data transformation, and validation.

Database Management: SQL for designing and managing a relational database schema to store Amazon's operational data.

Visualization and Dashboarding: Power BI for creating interactive dashboards that summarize and interpret the analyzed data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

4. Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we aim to:

Clean and preprocess Amazon's operational data using Python, ensuring data quality and consistency.
Build a robust SQL database schema to store cleaned data effectively.
Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insightful visualizations and facilitates data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.
5. Conclusion

This project highlights the integration of Python for data cleaning, SQL for database management, and Power BI for dashboard visualization in analyzing Amazon's operational data. By leveraging these tools effectively, we aim to empower stakeholders with actionable insights into Amazon's business operations and performance metrics.
